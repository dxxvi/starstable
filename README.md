Jox is a modern open-source library from SoftwareMill designed for virtual-thread-based concurrency and streaming in Java 21 and newer. It aims to provide safe and efficient tools for concurrent programming, drawing inspiration from languages like Go and Kotlin. Jox is built around three core modules: Channels, Structured Concurrency, and Flows.

### Key Features of Jox:

**1. Channels:**

Jox provides a powerful implementation of channels, which are a way for virtual threads to communicate with each other. These channels are inspired by Go's channels and offer a safe alternative to shared memory and locks, helping to prevent common concurrency issues like deadlocks and race conditions.

Key characteristics of Jox channels include:
*   **Go-like `select`:** This feature allows a thread to wait on multiple channel operations and proceed with the first one that becomes ready, enabling more complex and flexible concurrent patterns.
*   **Buffered and Rendezvous Channels:** Channels can be buffered, allowing a certain number of elements to be sent before the sender blocks, or they can be "rendezvous" channels where the sender and receiver must meet to exchange a value. Unbounded channels are also supported.
*   **Completable Channels:** Channels can be explicitly closed to signal that no more values will be sent, either normally or due to an error.
*   **Performance:** Jox channels are designed to be fast and scalable, with performance comparable to Java's built-in concurrent data structures. They also have a low memory footprint, making them suitable for use with a large number of virtual threads.

**2. Structured Concurrency:**

Jox offers a programmer-friendly API for structured concurrency, building upon the structured concurrency features introduced as a preview in Java 21 (JEP 453). Structured concurrency simplifies concurrent programming by ensuring that the lifetime of concurrent operations is tied to a specific lexical scope. This means that when a scope is exited, all concurrent tasks initiated within that scope are guaranteed to have completed, preventing thread leaks.

Jox's implementation provides a clear and safe way to manage concurrent forks, with well-defined error handling that ensures exceptions from any fork will terminate the entire scope.

**3. Flows (Streaming):**

For asynchronous data processing, Jox includes "Flows," a streaming library with a high-level functional API. Flows are designed to work with both finite and infinite streams of data and are compatible with the Reactive Streams standard.

Unlike standard Java Streams, Jox Flows are built for asynchrony and can leverage virtual threads for concurrent operations. This makes them well-suited for tasks that involve I/O or require time-based operations and parallel processing.

### Getting Started with Jox:

Jox is open-source and available on GitHub. Its documentation provides detailed information on each of its modules, along with examples to help developers get started. The library is sponsored by SoftwareMill, a software development and consulting company that also offers commercial support for Jox.
